    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"".

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as","```json

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863).

Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces.

In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained.

Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect.

Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as","```json

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams.

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as","```json

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion).

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress.

Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice"").

Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven . This is where the earth is conjoined with the star tribe, where humans come from. The entirety of Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world. The land of the Dakota surrounds the place where the Mississippi and Minnesota rivers converge, a place that marks the center of earth, just under the gate of heaven .

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power.

While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Context from notes:
    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

Native American Cosmologies (""Religion"") As one historian explained it: “The Religion of the American Indian turns out to be the multi - colored, many -layered religious patterns of hundreds of distinct Indian tribes and villages….” Religious Pluralism in the Americas was a given long before the arr ival of the varied religions of Europeans. As you will see when we look at Hinduism, looking at Native American ""religion"" is not that different than looking at India in its extreme diversity before it was given the illusory unifying term ""Hindu"" that was then connected to an ""ism"", thus inventing a new ""thing"" we call ""Hinduism"". In 2017, the American federal government recognized 567 different indigenous tribes in North America, and each of these tribes have their own stories, sacred spaces, and religious themes. Each one is it's own. Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

    Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Among these various traditions, there are no centralized leaders, no central theology, no shared foundational myths, no orthodoxy (""right belief"") or orthopraxy (""right practice""). There are no central text or founders. Each indigenous religion in America then would have to be looked at from its own cultural and geographical placement. Calling it a ""world religion"" may seem off (and perhaps it is), but no more than calling Hinduism a ""world religion"". Nonetheless, as with Hind uism, there are similarities in worldview, particularly in the idea of spirits that animate the world, vision quests to engage spirits, and cyclical time (as opposed to lineal time), and notions of reincarnation into animals and plant life. Rituals are hol istic, involving eating, hunting, death, birth, and puberty. The gist of Shoshoni religion (from the American west) by way of example is to maintain purity and honor spirits and sacred places, while seeking the supernatural power of visions and dreams. Visions and dreams give you eyes to see the other (higher) world , in a way that changes how you view this mundane world. This would be the ""groovin'"" aspect. Religious rituals intertwine all aspects of life, and when life is broken up, either from uprooting tribes off ancestral lands, sending children to federal Boardi ng Schools, or bringing in pipelines or reclaimed snow on sacred mountains, religion and culture are directly affected and sometimes rendered impossible. In a way that hinges upon land and geography, native religion structured and ordered all aspects of life. This is part of the ""Doin'"" side of things. Native religion is deeply woven together with geography, language, and people, as seen in the example of the Dakota below. Mni Sota Makoce: The Land of the Dakota Mni Sota [""where the water reflects the sky"" ] Makoce is seen by Dakota Indians as the place of human origin - the center of the world.

Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress.

Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies. Land is memory and a place of sacred power. Many Dakota have forgotten these stories, but as it is believed among the Dakota, the land remembers.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    ","Dakota, the land remembers.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained.

Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

    Question: Why is land considered central to the religion and cultural identity of the Dakota people?
    Student Answer: Land is central to Dakota religion and cultural identity because it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. Sacred spaces, rivers, lakes, rocks, and village sites carry generational and spiritual meaning, linking humans to their origin and the star tribe. Loss of land through trickery, wars, and urban development has been experienced as a loss of cultural identity, making indigenous religion inseparable from geographic spaces. The Dakota view land not just as territory but as memory and sacred power, holding stories, language, and ceremonies that maintain their spiritual and cultural continuity.

Minnesota, including its rivers, lakes, rocks, land forms, and village sites, all have generational and spiritual meaning. In an 1851 US treaty however, the Dakota were tricked off their land and forced onto a reservation in 1853. Trickery was a common practice for the US government against Native tribes as a means of acquiring their land for white settlement and corporate investment. In 1862, resentment grew and led to the 1862 war, which led to the creation of a concentration camp at Fort Snelling (1862 -1863). All Dakota were punished and terrorized though public killings of Dakota leaders and others, which got so bad, that President Abraham Lincoln stepped in and counter it. Lincoln commuted by executive order 250 Dakotas who were arranged to be publicly executed by hanging. As part of this war, the Dakota were exiled in 1863 from their ancestral lands, paving the way for the white development of the city of Minneapolis, Minnesota. Many however, years later, found their way back, and today there is a sizable population of Dakota in the city. Land has always been critical for the Dakota, as it represents the center of history and culture, where time and place are contained. It is the Prime Meridian of their cosmology (or religion). Land had long been regulated by seasonal patterns, with contact with white traders, government representatives, and missionaries as early as the 1600s. Though their ends were different, their goals were to change the Dakotas, either by taking their land, transforming them into agriculturalists (from hunters), or eradi cating their language, culture, traditions or dress. In the building of Minnesota, urban development, airport, and highway projects destroyed burial grounds and other sacred sites and made the protection of sacred sites largely ineffective. Sacred Power of Place Loss of land has been seen as a type of loss of cultural identity, making difficult to separate Indigenous religion from geographic spaces. Native religion is not faith or belief, but geography and its ancestral connections. However, for many indige nous tribes and nations, they have been denied access to these geographic spaces. It is important to include indigenous voices as a means of understanding their religion, but there has been a significant erasure of Native voices in Minnesota, as well as th roughout the US. Geographic spaces have history and memory in indigenous religion, marked by stories and practices that express their power. Collective memories make space sacred for the Dakota, and despite historical and continued threats by American corp orations and governmental policies, there continues an intimate relationship with this land. While still feeling the legal and cultural weight of bad faith governmental treaties and concentration camps, there has been recent attempts to reclaim this land a nd to educate others as to its history - a history not marked by possession, but rather that of sacred stories, language, and ceremonies.
