Understanding Time, Space, and Context: Identify when and where the events occurred and the conceptual frameworks involved. 4. Collecting Information: Gather evidence from sources such as inscriptions, manuscripts, coins, monuments, and written records. 5. Critical Examination: Verify authenticity of sources using language, script, authorship, and historical consistency. 6. Comparative Analysis: Analyze similarities and differences among events, societies, or time periods to find causal patterns. 7. Writing Historical Narrative: Present the findings in a structured, evidence-based narrative that logically connects facts.
