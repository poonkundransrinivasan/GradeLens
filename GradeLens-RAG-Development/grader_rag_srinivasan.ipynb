    "student_answer_correct_a = '''The historical research method is a very detailed and systematic process that historians use to study, analyse, and arrange the events of the past in a meaningful and scientific manner. It helps in understanding how societies developed, how cultures changed, and how human life evolved through different periods of time. The process of arranging history begins with examining the relevant references of the available historical information. This includes reading old documents, inscriptions, manuscripts, coins, travel accounts, and various written records that provide clues about the past. After that, historians move to the second stage, which is collecting historical information. In this stage, they gather as much data as possible and highlight the processes that led to important historical transitions, such as wars, reforms, revolutions, and discoveries. They also carry out comparative analysis between different time periods or regions to identify similarities and differences.\n",
    "The third stage involves understanding the references regarding time and space of the given historical events and the conceptual frameworks used in the research. This means historians must carefully study when and where an event happened and what social, political, and cultural ideas influenced it. The fourth stage is formulating relevant questions based on the historical references — for example, “Why did this event happen?” or “What were its effects?” These questions guide the direction of the research.\n",
    "After this, historians proceed to the fifth stage, which is formulating hypotheses. A hypothesis is a possible explanation or assumption that can later be tested with evidence. It helps historians focus on proving or disproving certain ideas about the past. The next important step is critically examining various sources of history, which means checking how reliable, authentic, and unbiased the collected data is. Historians compare different sources to avoid mistakes or false information.\n",
    "Finally, after completing all these steps, they write a historical narrative, which arranges the information in order and explains the causes and effects of events clearly. This whole process ensures that history is not just a story but a well-organized study based on facts, logic, and careful research. Thus, the stages of the historical research method help us to understand human civilization and the journey of mankind from the past to the present.\n",

Historiography : Indian Tradition 2.1 Tradition of Indian Historiography 2.2 Indian Historiography : Various Ideological Frameworks 2.1 Tradition of Indian Historiography We learnt about the western tradition of historiography in the last lesson. In this lesson we will know about the tradition of Indian historiography. Historiography in the Ancient Period : In the ancient period in India memories of the great deeds of ancestors and mythological lore, also memories of social transitions were preserved with the help of oral recitals. The inscriptions on the Harappan seals and other artefacts confirm that Indians had mastered the art of writing as early as the third millennium B.C.E. or perhaps before that. However, the Harappan script is not yet successfully deciphered. The earliest known written documents of historical nature found in India are in the form of inscriptions. They are dated to the 3rd century B.C.E., that is emperor Ashok Maurya’s times. His edicts are inscribed on natural rocks and stone pillars. From the 1st century C.E. inscriptions begin to occur on coins, metal images and sculptures, and also on copper plates. They provide important historical information. We get to know about the dates of various kings, dynastic genealogies, territorial extent and administration of various empires and kingdoms and also important political events, social organisation, climate, famines, etc. of the respective times. The ancient Indian literature including the epics Ramayana and Mahabharat, Puranas, Jain and Buddhist texts, historical accounts by Indian authors and also travelogues by foreign travellers are Sohagaura Copper-plate : The copper-plate was found at Sohagaura (District Gorakhpur, Uttar Pradesh). It is supposed to be from the Mauryan period. The inscription on it is in Brahmi script. The symbols known as ‘Tree-in-railing’ and ‘Mountain’ at the beginning of the inscription also occur on punch marked coins. Another\n",

      "the deeds of the members of ancient human societies of a particular period. History does not suggest any interrelation between the Divine and human deeds. Methods of various disciplines are useful in historical research. For example, Archaeology, Archival Science, Manuscriptology, Epigraphy (Study of inscriptions), Analysis of lettering style, Linguistics, Numismatics (Study of coins), Genealogy (Study of lineage), etc. 1.1 Tradition of Historiography We have learnt about the historical research method, critically examining the historical sources and writing the historical narrative. The writing of critical historical narrative is known as ‘Historiography’. A scholor who writes such a narrative is a historian. The historian cannot include every past event in his narrative. The inclusion and interpretation of historical events by the historian often depends on the conceptual framework adopted by him. His style of writing is determined by that conceptual framework. The tradition of writing historical narrative, that is historiography, was not prevalent in the ancient societies of the world. However, that does not mean that they were not aware of the historical time or were not eager to know about it. Ancient people also felt the need of passing on the stories of the life and valour of the ancestors to the next generation. Ancient communities all over the world used various means like cave paintings, story-telling, singing songs and ballads, etc. for this purpose. These traditional means are looked upon as the sources of history in the modern historiography. 1.2 Modern Historiography Four main characteristics of modern historiography : Do you know ? The above picture shows a fragment of the earliest inscription. A forward marching file of soldiers holding shields and spears is seen here. The General is in the front. The tradition of recording historical event can be traced back to Sumer civilisation in Mesopotamia. Names of Sumerian kings and the stories of battles fought by them have been preserved in various inscriptions. The earliest inscription shown above, dates back to 4500 B.C.E. It records a battle fought between two kingdoms. It is now displayed at the Louvre museum in France. The earliest inscription in the Louvre museum 3(3) Answers to these questions are supported by reliable evidence. (4) History presents a graph of mankind’s journey with the help of past human deeds. It is said that the modern historiography with above characteristics has its roots in the ancient Greek historical writings. ‘History’ is originally a Greek term. Herodotus, the Greek historian of the fifth century B.C.E. used it first for his book entitled, ‘The Histories’. 1.3 Development of Scientific Perspective in Europe and Historiography Till the eighteenth century C.E. Europe had achieved a remarkable progress in the fields of Philosophy and Science. Scholars by then had come to believe in the possibility of studying the social and historical truths by applying scientific methods. Now the philosophical discussions focused more and more on the objectivity in history and historiography. Prior to the eighteenth century all European universities were interested only in the philosophical discourses revolving around Divine phenomena. However, gradually this scenario began to change. In 1737 C.E. the Gottingen University was founded in Germany. This university for the first time had an independent department of history. Later, other German universities also became centres of historical studies. 1.4 Notable Scholars The contributions of many scholars are important in\n",

      "in Various Fields History is about the past events. The way our present life style is shaped, is dependent on the historical chain of events. Historical events relate to various fields like politics, social and religious structure of a community, philosophy, technology and science, etc. Each of these fields have their own history of building knowledge. The direction of future development in every field is dependent on the state of available knowledge. Hence, the method of history can prove to be of value in the research of various fields. For example, (1) Philosophy : The history of philosophy helps in understanding the origin of various ideologies, the intellectual traditions giving rise to those ideologies and their historical development. Philosophy needs language as a medium 3.1 What is Applied History ? 3.2 Applied History and Research in Various Fields 3.3 Applied History and Our Present 3.4 Management of Cultural and Natural Heritage 3.5 Affiliated Professional Fields 16of expression. In order to understand the philosophical expression, knowledge of the history of language proves useful. (2) Science : The history of science helps in understanding the chronological order of scientific discoveries, inventions and theories. It can also help to understand the cause-effect chain that led to those discoveries and inventions. It is said that ‘need’ is the mother of inventions. Scientific discoveries/inventions are often the effects of human efforts to fulfil a need and also curiosity. These efforts are based on already available scientific knowledge. Knowledge of history of science helps in understanding the factors that facilitated a scientific discovery/invention and also its chronology. (3) Technology : The history of technology helps in understanding the changes and their causes in the field of agricultural production, commodity production, architecture, engineering, etc. Scientific discoveries/inventions and technological advancement are mutually dependent on each other. Knowledge of science and technology was very important at every step from the making of stone tools to agricultural production in the evolution of mankind. Later the advancement of science promoted the mechanisation of production.
